## GameObject

it is an invisible container, it has a position and space, rotation and scale.

you can fill this **container** with components to add extra features.

ex. the bird, the pipes, the user interface, and the camera.



in the **Hierarchy** as in the Pipe gameObject, *Top Pipe* is called here a child. you use this so you can controle and move parent and its children together.

## Prefabricated GameObject (Prefabs)

we will make `Pipe` parent as **prefab**, by copying it to the assets file, and delete it from **Hierarchy** in the left section.
